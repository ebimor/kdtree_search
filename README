I have successfully compiled and tested this code on Linux 18.04 and 20.04

Please use the easy_build.sh file to build and compile this code
Once built, run
./bin/kdtree_search
and follow the command line messages

My assumption is that sample points in the dataset are 3D points (x,y,Theta)
where theta is between 0 to 2*pi and x and y are uniformly sampled from the space of dimension WIDTHxHEIGHT

Please also check the plot sample_points.png which plots 2D projection of datapoints in green circle,
you input point in red circle and the N nearest neighbors obtained from kdtree search by blue rectangle. You can
see that blue rectangles are on top of the closest red circles
